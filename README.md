# 📊 Excel & CSV Parsing React App

A lightweight and user-friendly React application built **to reliably parse Excel and CSV files before using the data with ChatGPT**.

This project was created because **ChatGPT’s direct Excel/CSV parsing can be inconsistent for complex or large files**. Instead of uploading files directly, this app lets users **extract clean, structured data from spreadsheets and copy it to the clipboard**, making it easy to paste accurate input into ChatGPT or any other AI tool.
